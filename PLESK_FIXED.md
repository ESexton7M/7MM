# 🚀 FIXED: Plesk Deployment for Asana Analytics

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Application Crashing**

The logs showed "application process exited prematurely" - this was because the Node.js app wasn't configured properly for Plesk's Passenger system.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**

1. **Created `app.js`** - Root-level Express app for Passenger
2. **Updated `package.json`** - Added proper main entry point and dependencies
3. **Created `startup.js`** - Passenger startup file
4. **Added `.htaccess`** - Apache/Passenger configuration
5. **Fixed file paths** - Adjusted for root-level deployment

## 📋 **New Deployment Steps for Plesk**

### **Step 1: Upload All Files**
Upload your entire project to:
```
/var/www/vhosts/analytics.7mountainscreative.com/httpdocs/
```

### **Step 2: Run Deployment Command**
```bash
cd /var/www/vhosts/analytics.7mountainscreative.com/httpdocs/
npm run deploy:plesk
```

### **Step 3: That's It!**
Passenger will automatically:
- ✅ Start the Node.js application
- ✅ Handle requests through `app.js`
- ✅ Serve your React frontend
- ✅ Provide API endpoints for caching

## 🌐 **Access Your Application**

Visit: `https://analytics.7mountainscreative.com`

**No port numbers needed!** Passenger handles everything through Apache.

## 📊 **Key Files Created**

- `app.js` - Main Express application for Passenger
- `startup.js` - Passenger startup script
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration
- Updated `package.json` - Proper dependencies and entry point

## 🔍 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Upload files to Plesk**
2. **Run**: `npm run deploy:plesk`
3. **Visit**: `https://analytics.7mountainscreative.com`
4. **Check for**:
   - ✅ No more 500 errors
   - ✅ API endpoints working (`/api/cache/status`)
   - ✅ Project tasks caching functional
   - ✅ No "application process exited" errors

## 🚨 **If You Still Have Issues**

### **Check Passenger Logs**
```bash
tail -f /var/www/vhosts/analytics.7mountainscreative.com/logs/error_log
```

### **Verify Dependencies**
```bash
cd /var/www/vhosts/analytics.7mountainscreative.com/httpdocs/
npm install
```

### **Check Permissions**
```bash
chmod -R 755 /var/www/vhosts/analytics.7mountainscreative.com/httpdocs/
```

## 🎯 **What's Different Now**

- **Before**: Trying to run standalone Node.js server (caused crashes)
- **After**: Proper Passenger/Apache integration
- **Before**: Port conflicts and manual server management
- **After**: Automatic handling through standard web server
- **Before**: Complex startup process
- **After**: Simple `npm run deploy:plesk` command

Your Asana Analytics should now work perfectly on Plesk! 🎉
